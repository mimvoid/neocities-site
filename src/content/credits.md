## Tools

Of course, I can't thank [Neocities][t1] enough for providing people a way to host their website!

I used their built-in editor at first, but switched to my preferred editor. It's thanks to the [Neocities CLI][t2] that I can edit this website on my computer and upload the files later.

Speaking of my editor, I use [Neovim][t3]! It supports LSPs that can spot errors in your code and provide suggestions. With Vim keybindings, navigating and editing files is quick and easy. There's a learning curve, but it's super fun once you get the hang of it. Plus, Neovim can be beautiful and very functional with the right plugins.

[Hugo][t4] is my static site generator of choiceâ€”it's fast for building *and* writing pages! Instead of HTML (super clunky), I can write in markdown. I can repeat sections like the header without copying code or using Javascript.

## Design

I drew the background myself! It was [inspired by these patterns](https://nonexistentfandomsfandom.neocities.org/graphics/backgrounds), made using [a base by cairovercoat](https://cairovercoat.tumblr.com/tagged/pixel+pattern). The site icon and favicon are also by me. Can you tell I love cats?

Several other backgrounds are from
[Subtle Patterns on Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns).

The colors were modified from [Catppuccin Macchiato](https://catppuccin.com). It's a very nice pastel color palette!

The icons are from [Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com) and [Pixelarticons](https://pixelarticons.com).

### Inspirations

The overall design was inspired by **TUIs** and **tiling window managers**. I find them really charming for their simplicity and design constraints. There was not one single inspiration, but some of them include:

- [Hyprland][i1], a dynamic window manager with great graphics
- [Dooit][i2], a terminal to-do list
- [Arttime][i3], a terminal time tracker with ascii art

They're also just nice projects in their own right!
