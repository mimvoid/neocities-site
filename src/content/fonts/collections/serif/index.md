I've never had much of a liking toward serif fonts, except for those that were
first and foremost [display fonts]({{% relref "fonts/collections/display" %}}).

Nevertheless, there are a few that have won me over.

## Bagnard

Look at those beautiful numbers and terminals!

## EB Garamond

EB Garamond is one of my favorite serif body fonts. It's classy and gets the job done.

## Libre Baskerville

Libre Baskerville my go-to font for a printed book feel.

## Spectral

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Spectral" lang="en ru" %}}

<span class="primary">Variant</span>: Extra Bold

<div style="font-weight: 800">
{{% pangram font="Spectral" lang="en ru" %}}
</div>

It makes quite the nice display font at high weights, but it also works well as a body font.
