Ah, monospace fonts. I'm a big fan, both because I'm a chronic terminal hermit and because
unlike [sans serif fonts]({{% relref "sans-serif" %}}), a majority of them don't look very
coporate or too geometric for my tastes. They have very distinct letterforms and a sort of
irregular charm.

Unfortunately, they're not the best fonts for *readability*, especially not for long stretches
of prose. Oftentimes, the "w" and the "m" look too narrow, or the "l" and the "i" have too
much whitespace. It's very apparent if you bump the font size up, in headings for example.

**"Faux monospace"** fonts, as I've come to call them, can be the best of both worlds! They're
mostly monospace, but widen or narrow some of the glyphs for readability.

So far, I haven't been able to find many. If you know some, please please tell me about them!

## Texture Healing Fonts

The title is a bit of a lie, not all of the fonts here will be "faux monospace". The following
are true monospace fonts, but employ a special feature called
[**texture healing**](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/blob/main/docs/Texture%20Healing.md)!
Basically, the font lets some glyphs take up more space within their cell, while the surrounding
letters are made narrower so they don't look too cramped. Unlike "faux monospace" fonts, you can
still use these in the terminal, but it may or may not support texture healing.

### Monaspace

Nerd font variant: [Monaspice][nf]

{{% license "ofl" %}}

#### Monaspace Neon

{{% pangram font="Monaspace Neon" %}}

#### Monaspace Argon

{{% pangram font="Monaspace Argon" %}}

#### Monaspace Xenon

{{% pangram font="Monaspace Xenon" %}}

#### Monaspace Radon

{{% pangram font="Monaspace Radon" %}}

#### Monaspace Krypton

{{% pangram font="Monaspace Krypton" %}}

Monaspace and its team at Lettermatic pioneered the texture healing feature!

The variety in this font family is astounding. I've seen many people use Monaspace Radon
for comments to separate them visually from the rest of the code.

### 0xProto

[Homepage](https://github.com/0xType/0xProto)

Nerd Font variant: [0xProto][nf]

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="0xProto" %}}

<div style="font-style: italic">
{{% pangram font="0xProto" %}}
</div>

0xProto is actually what I currently use for my terminal font!

It was made specifically for readability with *very* distinct letterforms. Its italics
are quite pretty, especially after I had gotten used to the plain italics of
[Hasklig]({{% relref "monospace#hasklig" %}}) and [Source Code Pro]({{% relref "monospace#source-code-pro" %}}).

## Faux Monospace

### iA Writer Fonts

[Homepage](https://ia.net/topics/a-typographic-christmas)

[Source](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts)

{{% license "ofl" %}}

#### iA Writer Duo

{{% pangram font="iA Writer Duo" lang="en ru" %}}

<span class="primary">Variant</span>: Bold

<div style="font-weight: bold">
{{% pangram font="iA Writer Duo" lang="en ru" %}}
</div>

iA Writer Duospace Bold used to be the heading font of my website!

#### iA Writer Quattro

{{% pangram font="iA Writer Quattro" lang="en ru" %}}

The iA Writer fonts were modified from [IBM Plex](https://github.com/IBM/plex).

As their names imply, Duo features two character widths while Quattro features four.
You can almost mistake Quattro as a fully proportional font, but it does only use a
few widths.

There is also iA Writer Monospace, a true monospace font.

### Trispace

[Homepage](https://etceteratype.co/trispace)

[Source](https://github.com/Etcetera-Type-Co/Trispace)

{{% license "ofl" %}}

#### Trispace Condensed

{{% pangram font="Trispace Condensed" %}}

#### Trispace SemiCondensed

{{% pangram font="Trispace SemiCondensed" %}}

#### Trispace

{{% pangram font="Trispace Regular" %}}
<div style="font-weight: 800">
{{% pangram font="Trispace" %}}
</div>

Trispace ExtraBold is what I currently use for my website's headings!

#### Trispace Expanded

{{% pangram font="Trispace Expanded" %}}

Trispace is not a font I see mentioned too often, but it's genuinely so cool!
It's variable in both *width* and *weight*. The homepage presentation is very nice too.

It hits a pretty good sweet spot between a monospace look and readable character widths
with a ton of variability. Thank you Etcetera Type Company and Tyler Finck!
