Karla used to be the body font of my website!

It's a nice friendly-looking font with an air of playfulness.

## Nunito

Nunito is distinct for its round terminals, which I don't see in many non-display
sans serif fonts. It works pretty well as a simple body font.

The variant [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans) has more
standard non-rounded terminals.

## Mulish

I used this font a ton in my earlier school days, so it has a sort of nostalgia for me.

I remember it by its original name Muli, which was 
[changed in 2020](https://github.com/googlefonts/mulish/commit/e268b235f32aa7472c4aa22b59d0854ae5420c97).

Unlike many modern fonts, it has a single story "a" like everyday handwriting.

## Cantarell

{{% pangram font="Cantarell" %}}

Cantarell is well-known in the Linux world for its use by the [GNOME project](https://www.gnome.org),
which was also how I was introduced to it.

As a humanist font, it has a warm feel to it.

Cantarell has a different version on Google Fonts. However, it hasn't been updated
there due to one of Cantarell's main drawbacks, the lack of an explicit italic variant.

GNOME has since been working to
[replace their default UI font](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/initiatives/-/issues/152)
with [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter).
