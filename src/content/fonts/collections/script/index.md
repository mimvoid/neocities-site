{{% pangram font="Bukhari Script" %}}

The designer from Mikrojihad Inc. also called this a "Mouse Lettering Typeface" because it
originated from a bold line with a computer mouse!

This font has many more alternate glyphs and other OpenType features, please check out its
homepage presentation.

<span class="primary">Variant</span>: Playwrite Hrvatska

{{% pangram font="Playwrite HR" lang="hr" %}}

Playwrite is a huge font family with cursive styles from across the world.
The two samples above are some of my favorites, and are only a small fraction of
the handwriting models Playwrite portrays.

## Handwriting

### Itim

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Itim" lang="th en" %}}

Itim has such regularity that you can almost mistake it for a typical sans serif font with
round terminals. It has a subtlety that makes it perfect for clean yet playful designs.

### Rock Salt

### Shantell Sans

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Shantell Sans" lang="en ru" %}}

Shantell Sans is a wonderful and versatile font based on the handwriting of dyslexic
artist Shantell Martin. You might have heard of it as "the new Comic Sans" (in a positive way),
with a similar irregularity and personality.

They did a great job with the homepage presentation!

### Swanky and Moo Moo

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Swanky and Moo Moo" %}}

This font is based on a young mother's handwriting and is named after her family's nicknames,
which I found adorable!

It reminds me a bit of my own handwriting too.

## Both

### Bad Script

[Homepage](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bad+Script)

[Source](https://github.com/alexeiva/badscript)

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Bad Script" lang="en ru" %}}

It's name is rather ironic given how pretty I find it.

### Gogol

[Homepage](https://www.paratype.com/fonts/pt/gogol)

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Gogol" lang="ru" %}}

Gogol is a Russian typeface based on Nikolai Gogol's handwriting from his letters and
drafts for *Mertvye Dushi*.

It's not very extensive (and doesn't support Ukrainian), but it's interesting nontheless.

### Homemade Apple

{{% pangram font="Homemade Apple" %}}

What texture!

[Source](https://github.com/googlefonts/meow-script)

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="Meow Script" %}}

I had to include this font, if only for the name alone. Plus, it's quite beautiful!

### Oooh Baby

{{% license "ofl" %}}

{{% pangram font="WindSong" %}}

I find WindSong very elegant and refined. Sometimes I use it to represent signatures.
