**Sacoglossa** is a superorder of shelled and unshelled marine gastropods, also known as **sea snails**
and **sea slugs**.

They feed on algae, which is why they're sometimes called sap-sucking slugs.

Some members take it a step further, and steal the algae's chloroplasts for themselves in a behavior
known as kleptoplasty. These chloroplasts serve as extra energy sources. They're one of the few
animals out there that technically do *photosynthesis*!

One of the most well-known members of Sacoglossa is the leaf sheep!

These adorable little fellows look like they have beady little eyes, pink blush, and a body
like a bunch of flowering cacti.
