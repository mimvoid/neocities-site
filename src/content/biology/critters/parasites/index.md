**Note**: _Don't take anything here as medical advice. I'm not sure why you would, but don't._

Parasites get a pretty bad rap, and for good reason: they're the embodiment of free-loaders,
can severely damage their hosts, and have a strong disgust factor. I'm not too fond of
them, so I probably won't make any pages dedicated to a parasite unless it's particularly
interesting.

That said, parasites are a very important part of their ecosystems. They make up over half
of all species on Earth, and 85–95% of them could be unknown to science[^1]. They can control
population growths like any other predator. Many also encourage their hosts to be preyed upon,
such as _Toxoplasma gondii_[^2].

Host-parasite coevolution is often used as an example for the **Red Queen hypothesis**. It
provides an explanation for why so many organisms favor sexual reproduction over asexual
reproduction, despite needing two individuals instead of one.[^3] Its name is based on a quote
from _Through The Looking-Glass_[^4] (also known as _Alice in Wonderland_):

> "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."

> — _The Red Queen_

Essentially, parasites target common host genotypes. Individuals with **rare resistance alleles**
have a fitness advantage, so they reproduce more and spread their alleles. But once those
alleles become common, the parasite evolves against them, and they lose their resistance.
Different resistance alleles become rare, which gives a fitness advantage, and the cycle repeats.

Sexual reproduction allows many combinations of alleles, including _rare_ combinations. Asexual
reproduction does not, so parasites disproportionately target them.[^3]

## Noteworthy Parasites

### Pork Tapeworm

_Taenia solium_

As its common name suggests, _T. solium_ normally infects pigs. It can infect humans, however.
Like other tapeworms, the adults hang out in your intestines. The _eggs_, however, are on a whole
other level. Seriously, those things are the stuff of nightmares!

Undercooked pork shouldn't have tapeworm eggs[^5], but if someone already has a tapeworm, they may
come into contact with the eggs it expels and proceed to contaminate food or water that a human
then consumes.

The eggs hatch in the gut and the larvae travel all throughout the body. The body forms cysts
around the larvae, a condition called **cysticercosis**. These cysts can be _huge_ and may be
in the muscles, the eyes, and even the brain, where they're known to cause seizures.[^5]
_**Yikes upon yikes!!!**_

[Chubbyemu](https://www.youtube.com/@chubbyemu) has not one but _two_ videos about this.[^6][^7]
I remember seeing a video of surgeons removing a huge white blob parasite from someone's _skull_
as a child... Turns out, it was a tapeworm cyst.

I _really_ don't recommend watching or looking up any images if you're sensitive about this stuff.
