### Ability

**Name**: Refraction

**Description**

Everett can transfer wounds to the last entity with which they had physical contact.
Such entities have only found to be humans, shadows, and parasites.

Activation can be triggered manually or automatically after death.

An indication leading up to ability activation is the formation of a floating
ring of blood above their head, reminiscent of a halo.

After activation, Everett's transferred wounds heal at an abnormally fast pace.
No blood is recovered and no foreign bodies removed.
