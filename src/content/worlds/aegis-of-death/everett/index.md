### Ability

**Name**: Refraction

**Description**

Everett can transfer wounds to the last entity with which they had physical contact.
Such entities have only found to be humans, shadows, and parasites.

Activation can be triggered manually or automatically after death.

An indication leading up to ability activation is the formation of a floating
ring of blood above their head, reminiscent of a halo.

After activation, Everett's transferred wounds heal at an abnormally fast pace.
No blood is recovered and no foreign bodies removed.

## File 1: Behavior {.section}

### Description

Everett Dayal may be likened to a prism.

Their demeanor shifts with the moment. They say very little about themselves. It's difficult
to keep track of what their core personality is, or if they have one at all.

Their attention may be easily swayed in one moment, and impossible to capture the next.
Their interests are volatile, and so are their beliefs.

However, there are some details to be certain of.

Everett has uncanny ability to stay still and silent for long periods of time. It may be to observe,
to think, to hide. Many struggle to keep track of them, or are startled when they approach
from behind.

When in combat, they rely mainly on *instinct*. In such a state, their quick reactions and
singular mindset prove to be quite valuable. However, they struggle with unexpected situations
and recognizing they are pushing their limits in the moment.

They are easily swayed by feelings of obligation and guilt. Offer them your companionship,
worm into their sense of debt and of morals, and you can convince them to do *anything*.

### Traits

- Awful at shouting. They often have to try several times before they're loud enough.
- Fiddles with parts of his clothes (especially their neck tie and sleeves) when nervous.
- They're quite patient, and rarely get restless in a waiting room. They hardly even browse their
phone as they wait.
- Has a morbid interest in human anatomy and injuries.
