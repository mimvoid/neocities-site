## Foreword

It has only been a decade since the first reported resurrections and contact with The Herald.

It does not listen to our requests. It chooses what it wants.

It chooses those suffering at death, and grants them their dying wish.

It's interesting, isn't it, to be able to cheat death? To have another chance,
to breathe again, to live again, to defend the people with newfound powers?
To be among a chosen few? To have a being that can only be likened to a god look upon you? 
How breathtaking is it?

How breathtaking.

Things of mist and eyes and an enmity toward humanity.

The more eyes it has, the more developed and powerful it seems to become.

Parasites fully capable of mimicking humans are designated **███ █████████**.
