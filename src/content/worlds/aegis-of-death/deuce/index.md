<span class="tertiary">Disclaimer</span>: I hate this man so very much. I hate having to
draw his stupid little face and his stupid smug smile. He's despicable, and he's one of the
few original characters of mine that I thoroughly hate. I wish he was never born
(I'm exaggerating, but still).

So, uh, just know I don't condone his actions even if I literally wrote him. He's an antagonist
and a villain for a reason.
